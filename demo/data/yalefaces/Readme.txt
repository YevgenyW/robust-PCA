			The Yale Face Database
			----------------------

The database contains 165 GIF images of 15 subjects (subject01, 
subject02, etc.).  There are 11 images per subject, one  for each 
of the following facial expressions or configurations: center-light, 
w/glasses, happy, left-light, w/no glasses, normal, right-light, 
sad, sleepy, surprised, and wink.  Note that the image "subject04.sad" 
has been corrupted and has been substituted by "subject04.normal".

All the images including this readme file are contained in the file 
"yalefaces.tar". It can be unpacked with:

    tar xvf yalefaces.tar

A directory called "yalefaces" will be created containing all the images.
These can be viewed using "xv" or ported with any software package that 
can understand the GIF format.

You are free to use the Yale Face Database for research purposes. 
If experimental results are obtained that use images from within the
database, all publications of these results should acknowledge the use
of the "Yale Face Database" and cite

Without permission from Yale, images
from within the database cannot be incorporated into a larger database
which is then publicly distributed.
